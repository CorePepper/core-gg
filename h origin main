    Refactor Features Component
    
    Refactor the Features.tsx file to improve code readability and maintainability. Separate the feature section, card UI, and button into distinct components, such as creating a FeatureCard component for individual card displays. Organize styles into reusable CSS or theme files, extract common logic into reusable functions, and reduce the overall line count for better readability. Provide an explanation of the file structure and changes made after the refactor.
